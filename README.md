# Equipment tracker

Equipments are tagged with barcodes; trainees have RFId cards and borrow and return equipments; and employees use a tablet to scan and search equipment. 

This a working Android IONIC prototype (frontend). It may use any REST API for backend which provides the API used in the $db factory (app.js). For testing, I use MongoDB, MongoExpress and RestHeart docker containers.
